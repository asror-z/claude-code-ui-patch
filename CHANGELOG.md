## 1.0.0

Initial release. Adds settings that reach font sizes and a few behaviors Claude Code otherwise pins, by editing the installed extension's bundled files in place and reverting cleanly on demand.

### Highlights

- **Chat panel/tab:** code-block font size, plus the Edit-diff card's font size, its line-number gutter, and light/dark theme sync (the latter two as on/off toggles). The native `chat.fontSize` is surfaced alongside them.
- **Plan-mode Markdown preview:** font sizes for the rendered text, code, selected-text quote, comment input, and comment badge.
- **Status bar + panel:** hover the status bar for current values; open the panel for `▼`/`▲` sizing, On/Off toggles, per-knob sync dots, and Discard / Restore.
- **Resilient:** native values are captured per Claude Code version, and settings are re-applied after a Claude Code update reverts the patch.

### Commands

- `Claude Code UI Patch: Open Panel`
- `Claude Code UI Patch: Restore Font Sizes`
